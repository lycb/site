description: "Why I decided to start blogging"

I came across [Shu Ding's blog](https://shud.in/) a couple of months back when I was researching similar projects for my [senior thesis](https://ly86.chaulyjenny.com/home). 

Shu's website has a simple yet elegant feel to it. I like it so much that I decided that I wanted my website to be simple (although I'm not sure if it's as elegant as Shu's).

What I like more than the simplicity was reading Shu's posts (the ones written in English because that was all I could understand). Shu's thoughts on [COVID](https://shud.in/posts/covid-btc-m1) inspired me to start documenting my thoughts and remove unhealthy distractions.

> Last year I started to take notes of my dreams. I started to make creative artworks with code. I started to read poems.

COVID had affected me negatively the past year (as I'm sure it did for many people). I moved back home to be near family for some time, but my study space was in the basement. It was dark, lonely, and cold. I grew sad and couldn't find the strength to do anything productive.

I am happier now and keeping myself motivated. I work on my thesis regularly, study Chinese, and do some self-reflections. 

I also read some blogs now, because people are interesting:
