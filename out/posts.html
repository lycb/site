Maybe I didn't enjoy some classes that much because they were hard, but I certainly learned a lot from them. I try to think about my first programming class in 2017 as a freshman in college. I was a lost, confused girl sitting in a room full of males. Looking back, most of the things I learned in this class became second nature to me today. I didn't have to think twice about why I need getters and setters or create the main method to run my Java program. But I don't think my first programming class was enjoyable or great in particular. It was a confusing class, and I struggled with understanding the concepts. I thought about maybe changing my major to Math.\n\n\n\nMy second programming class was CS2440, and this was much more enjoyable. The course was more challenging but didn't feel too overwhelming. It just felt like a complicated puzzle that must be solved. The professor was fantastic, but his in-class assignments were especially brutal. I got to learn from brilliant girls in my class during our many in-class group assignments. I was so jealous of their intelligence that I made sure to strive to understand the materials.  \n\n\n\nCS2440 may be the turning point for me. I enjoyed coming to class, enjoyed learning the materials, and enjoyed doing the homework. But, most importantly, I understood the materials and grew. \n\n\n\nSpring 2018, my second semester at App, I saw a friend I met from a hackathon posted about her trip to Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) in 2017. I thoughtlessly applied for a scholarship to go to GHC 2018. To be honest, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. Fast-forward a couple of months, and I got the scholarship! They flew me out to Houston, booked me a hotel room, and everything. \n\n\n\nI was blown away. Women technologists were everywhere. I've never seen so many women with PhDs in the same room before. It was amazing. Tech talks opened my mind to so many cutting edge technology. And then there was the career fair. I remember talking to so many companies desperately trying to find an internship. But as a sophomore who only just finished her CS2440 class, no one wanted to hire me. I almost lost hope. But on the last day and two hours before the conference ended, I talked to Nationwide and landed my first internship. \n\n\n\nThe first lesson I learned from GHC is to take a chance because if I never applied to the scholarship, I would've never gotten the job and learned so much. The second lesson is never to give up hope. Even if you are inexperienced, you have a chance. If you give up, however, you only have a 0% chance. By the time I speak with Nationwide, I have already said my elevator pitch 100 times prior. Heck, I was tired, but I sure am glad that I tried. \n\n"]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts","query":{},"buildId":"fszyFMspsGlsm3MdOB8cN","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-483e9e96b8aec87b069a.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-89a0b570c030acf47156.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-0e7e1fec54158056e2a2.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.29f9e2f3d4a33bafbaa5.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.7af247b43e14ac66e88e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-fc6dfe80e0db721f82d3.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/9f96d65d.e84e24a909b34e545eb6.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/8bb326059d6c9bfcb99c6392a5ff1c27424d5834.8fc3783d8cd60fc929b1.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/posts-dd07987f2444bc34df6b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/fszyFMspsGlsm3MdOB8cN/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/fszyFMspsGlsm3MdOB8cN/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
